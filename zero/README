**alphabetcount.c**

Description:
The alphabetlettercount function counts the frequency of each alphabet letter (a-z, case insensitive) in all the .txt files under
directory of the given path and write the results to a file named as filetowrite.

Implementation:
1. Open path directory and retrieve input file names
2. Concatenate the path and the file names and store full path of files into an array
3. Create an array which stores the ascii values of the alphabet
4. Iterate through each input file 
5. Read a character one by one and compare to each alphabet letter
6. Increment the integer corresponding to the alphabet's index in the alphabetfreq array
7. Create a "result" directory if it has not already been made
8. Write all letter frequencies to filetowrite path

How To Run:
1. Change directory to path : "../zero"
3. Compile using : "make testalphabet"
4. Run using : "./testalphabet"
5. Results will be outputted to path : "../result/result.txt"


**specialcharcount.c**

Description:
The specialcharcount function counts the frequency of the following 5 special characters:
  ','   '.'   ':'    ';'    '!'
in all the .txt files under directory of the given path and write the results to a file named as filetowrite.

Implementation
1. Open path directory and retrieve input file names
2. Concatenate the path and the file names and store full path of files into an array
3. Create an array which stores the ascii values of the special characters
4. Iterate through each input file 
5. Read a character one by one and compare to each special character
6. Increment the integer corresponding to the special character's index in the charfreq array
7. Create a "result" directory if it has not already been made
8. Write all special character frequencies to filetowrite path

How To Run:
1. Change directory to path : "../zero"
3. Compile using : "make testspecial"
4. Run using : "./testspecial"
5. Results will be outputted to path : "../result/result.txt"
